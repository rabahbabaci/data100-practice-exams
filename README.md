# Data 100 Practice Exams

Curated exam-style practice sets for UC Berkeley Data 100. Each folder mirrors the real course assessment structure so you can drill one exam per day without interpreter access.

## Structure
- `midterm1/` — Weeks 1–5 topics (Pandas, EDA, regex, viz, sampling, intro modeling)
- `midterm2/` — (placeholder) Weeks 6–10 once the course progresses
- `midterm3/` — (placeholder) For semesters that include a third midterm
- `final/` — (placeholder) Comprehensive cumulative practice

Every notebook follows the official constraints:
- Text/MC answers only (no Jupyter execution)
- Collapsible solutions for self-grading
- Coverage log per folder to track topic balance

## Usage
1. Pick the latest notebook in the relevant exam folder.
2. Work through it offline or in a notebook viewer—no interpreter needed.
3. Record what felt rough; the next day’s set will include targeted drills plus a fresh full exam.
