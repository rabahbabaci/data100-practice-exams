# Midterm 1 Practice – Day 2 Coverage

| # | Topic / Skill | Question(s) | Fresh Twist vs Day 1 |
|---|---------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Pandas indexing & slicing** (boolean masks, `.set_index`, multi-index tuples, `.nunique`) | claw Q1, claude Q1 | New checkpoint/check-in contexts with duplicate index labels, chained boolean filters, and `.nunique()` reasoning instead of basic scalar lookups. |
| 2 | **GroupBy, aggregation, filter/head** | claw Q2, claude Q2 | BART turnstiles + hourly flight logs emphasize row counts coming out of `.size()`, `.head(1)`, multi-key aggregates, and group-level `filter` conditions (>=400 avg riders, delayed-count constraint). |
| 3 | **Regex extraction** | claw Q3, claude Q3 | Different aviation sentences target gate codes, zone labels, 24h timestamps, and airline flight IDs to keep capturing groups varied. |
| 4 | **EDA / Visualization selection** | claw Q4, claude Q4 | Snack study + battery lab scenarios reinforce single-variable distribution choices vs numeric–numeric or category–numeric comparisons; includes KDE vs histogram vs pie, scatter/hexbin vs box/violin misuses. |
| 5 | **Sampling error & bias reasoning** | claw Q5, claude Q5 | Two survey redesigns (AirBART texts, transit pass emails) stress how SRS size, reminders, and weighting affect chance error, response, non-response, and selection bias independently. |
| 6 | **Loss intuition (MAE/MSE, constant models, outliers)** | claw Q6, claude Q6 | Mix of Always/Never/Sometimes conceptual prompts plus MAE/MSE computations with integer-friendly datasets; claw focuses on outlier impact + MAE, claude on scaling and MSE. |
| 7 | **Gradient / partial derivative ID** | claw Q7, claude Q7 | Distinct models (log term with \(x_i^2\) vs exponential term) so students practice recognizing the correct chain-rule factor for θ₂ and θ₁. |
